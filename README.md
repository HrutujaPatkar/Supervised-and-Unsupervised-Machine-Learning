# Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
In this project, we used supervised and unsupervised learning to predict bike rental counts based on different factors.

We explore the various factors that influence bike rental capacity, with a particular focus
on seasonal patterns, weather, day of the week and time of day. The study examines the use of rented
bicycles in Seoul from late 2017 to early 2018 to predict the factors determining the rented bikes.
